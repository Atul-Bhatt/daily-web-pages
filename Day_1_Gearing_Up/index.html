		A paragraph (from the Ancient Greek παράγραφος paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
